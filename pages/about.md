# About The Weekend Admin's Guide

The Weekend Admin's Guide gets its start from a security professional who took on Office 365 administration duties for a small non-profit. Simultaneously under and overwhelmed by the configuration possibilities, documentation, and examples on the web, a desire to provide a single starting point was born.

The Weekend Admin's Guide aims to be a starting point for anyone out there just trying to keep their small organization's tools up and running. The Guide aims to provide tips, tricks, best practices, workarounds, and operational recommendations for configuring, reviewing, and maintaining platforms like Microsoft 365.

The Weekend Admin's Guide is **NOT** a one stop shop or a perfect resource. Where ever possible, the Guide will link to external resources for further learning. Despite our best efforts, he Guide _will_ be wrong at some point. It's on you to understand what it is that you're doing and that it makes sense. The Guide is not responsible for any actions that you take. We're always looking to improve and expand the Guide. Have a tool that you'd like to see added? Let us know! Have recommendations or questions? Send them our way!
